# Laravel Sandbox

This my personal laraval sandbox when testing new things regarding Laravel, whether it be Eloquent/Artisan related.

### Installing

Simply clone it and place it where you can host it locally whether it be with XAMPP or whatever you like using. Then install node dependencies.


```
git clone https://github.com/chaseolsen/laravelsandbox.git
```

And NPM install

```
npm install
```

## Notable Technologies Used

* Artisan (To create controllers, migrations, and models)
* Eloquent (For functionality to DB, rather than using queries, definitely a must have when deveoping within Laravel)
* Tinker (Primarily for interaction with DB through my command line)
